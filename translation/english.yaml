If you want to control who can use your credit card or current balance in the <L_NEP/>, you do that through your <L_N10/> Account from the app, or by visiting the site on your PC or smart device.<NL/><NL/>And hey, if you're a kid reading this, maybe show it to your parents so you can all be totally comfortable with your <L_NS/> experience!<NL/>"
