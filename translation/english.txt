482c4d44ce=Hey parents and guardians, you've probably figured out that the <L_NS/> console has Parental Controls built in, but did you know there are other features you can use through your <L_N10/> Account and your smart device?<NL/><NL/>Obviously you can use the built-in controls to do pretty much everything you need-keep the little ones from playing the Teen and Mature rated games and whatnot, but the app is pretty handy!<NL/><NL/>To download the <L_NST/> Parental Controls app, go to the App Store on your iOS device or the Google Play Store on your Android device.<NL/>Once you've got the app registered to your console, it'll keep track of what everyone's playing and lets you set limits on total play time in a day for certain users.<NL/><NL/>Oh, one more thing! If you want to control who can use your credit card or current balance in the <L_NEP/>, you do that through your <L_N10/> Account from the app, or by visiting the site on your PC or smart device.<NL/><NL/>And hey, if you're a kid reading this, maybe show it to your parents so you can all be totally comfortable with your <L_NS/> experience!<NL/>
